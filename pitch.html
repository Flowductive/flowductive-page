    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 1</p>
    <p>
      Hi, my name is Ben Myers and I’m excited to present Flowductive to you.
      <br>
      For users who want to manage their free time effectively, we help them stay driven by providing Flows - a fun,
      social, and unique way to commit time to different types of productive activity.
      <br>
      Our app allows you to track and sync your tasks and events, and it challenges you to dedicate productive time
      using Flows, while also allowing you to connect and encourage your friends.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_2.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 2</p>
    <p>
      Over 100 million people own a personal digital calendar, such as Outlook, Apple Calendar, and Google Calendar.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_3.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 3</p>
    <p>
      Yet less than 1 percent actually use them. Why is this?
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_4.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 4</p>
    <p>
      It’s mainly because:
      <br>
      - Calendar apps are clunky to use,<br>
      - They’re only beneficial when a certain critical amount of data is entered,<br>
      - Many small tasks and fires in a daily routine make rigid scheduling pointless, and<br>
      - Digital task completion is not as rewarding compared to “crossing things off” on paper.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_5.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 5</p>
    <p>
      One of the major ways that Flowductive solves these problems is by introducing Flows, a quick and flexible way to
      manage the times in your day that aren’t associated with a particular event. It looks like my current Flow has 3
      cards; let’s see
      how it works.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_6.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 6</p>
    <p>
      My first card is a 30 minute Health. Once I press Start on my iPhone, I’ll commit 30 minutes to improving my
      personal health. Maybe I’ll go to the gym.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_7.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 7</p>
    <p>
      Next, I’ve got a 15 minute Growth card. During this time, I think I’ll go out and take a walk for my personal
      mental health.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_8.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 8</p>
    <p>
      And, for my last card, I’ll commit an hour to getting some work done.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_9.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 9</p>
    <p>
      There are thousands of ways you can customize your Flow. Maybe you’ll want to start out with a workout; or perhaps
      you’ll want to commit much more time to working on your tasks.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_10.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 10</p>
    <p>
      Getting a Flow started is designed to be quick and easy.
      <br>
      All you need to do is enter your tasks,
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_11.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 11</p>
    <p>
      Enter your events,
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_12.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 12</p>
    <p>
      And Flowductive will recommend Flows for you made by other users that match your schedule!
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_13.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 13</p>
    <p>
      The whole idea behind Flows is to ensure that they are flexible. Instead of having a pre-made schedule for when to
      exercise, or complete your tasks, Flowductive has you play ‘cards’ throughout the day when you’re available.
      <br>
      In this way, we’re hoping that Flows will be a unique solution to help stay motivated throughout the day.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_14.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 14</p>
    <p>
      One of the main core features Flowductive has to offer is a rich task-tracking system.
      <br>
      Our goal is to make the completion of tasks as rewarding and satisfying as possible through social and visual
      encouragement.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_15.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 15</p>
    <p>
      Another great feature we have to offer is third-party syncing. We want to minimize the amount of time you spend
      entering your tasks and events, so we try to do that for you.
      <br>
      We’re not trying to replace the calendar market; rather, we are working to be in conjunction with it. The app will
      be able to sync with popular third-party calendar applications to shorten the data-entry time, helping you stay
      even more focused
      on managing your unplanned time.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_16.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 16</p>
    <p>
      Flowductive features a one-of-a-kind social system, a feature uncommon in the productivity industry. Users can
      follow and friend each other; see their activity (including flows and active tasks, if opted), and can send
      encouragement
      notifications to one another.
      <br>
      By targeting people who want to improve the way they stay motivated, we know that through a system like this,
      users will help us build a strong community of people who encourage one another to stay productive.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_17.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 17</p>
    <p>
      Our mission is to redesign the way that you accomplish that. We strive to do this through a few guiding
      principles:
      <br>
      Make staying updated as clean, simple, and quick as possible.
      Relish in the unpredictability of life and embrace flexibility.
      Make task and flow completion rewarding and satisfying.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_18.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 18</p>
    <p>
      Todoist, TickTick, and Things are all calendar and task list apps with many great and powerful features. However,
      most calendar/task apps don’t have a strong social aspect, and most don’t provide unique ways to motivate users to
      do more than
      what is just on their task list.
      <br>
      Apps like Fabulous, Motivate, and ThinkUp offer solutions to stay motivated and even block out time, but none of
      these follow Flowductive’s unique time-blocking system.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_19.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 19</p>
    <p>
      Despite the competition, we pride ourselves on some key advantages.
      <br>
      We are free-to-use. Many other motivational apps start out with paid subscriptions.
      Our app is captivating. Our community and gamification of tasks and flows holds an engaged userbase.
      And we’re unique. We aim to provide a distinct solution for staying motivated.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_20.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 20</p>
    <p>
      Flowductive has an applicable market of over 51 million Americans, and this has a lot of potential for growth.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_21.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 21</p>
    <p>
      Introducing a desktop platform will increase the target demographic by 13 million Americans.
      <br>
      Going worldwide could expand that market to over 300 million people within the mobile industry.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_22.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 22</p>
    <p>
      We want to be more than just a productivity app. We value building a strong community of people who strive to stay
      productive. We don’t want to replace the way you stay organized; we want to help improve the way you stay
      committed to what needs
      to get done.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_23.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 23</p>
    <p>
      Here is an overview of our timeline. We plan to launch in September and begin developing for web and android
      shortly afterwards.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_24.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 24</p>
    <p>
      As for our business model: Once we’ve acquired a sufficient userbase, we plan to generate profit through brand
      sponsors and a premium plan. In the future, we also plan to open up some additional enterprise solutions.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

    <img src="pitch_images/pitch_25.png" width="100%" label="Slide 1">
    <p class="text-secondary">Slide 25</p>
    <p>
      In terms of acquiring new users, we plan to grow our community through the typical methods of advertising and
      social sharing options. Our friend/follower system is also projected to increase our engagement and growth.
    </p>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 64px"></div>

      And finally, to quickly introduce myself, my name is Ben and I have been working hard on Flowductive so we can
      have a timely release. I’m a UCLA undergraduate studying mathematics.

      This has been Flowductive. I hope that you are excited as I am to redesign your day, and I look forward to your
      comments. Thank you.
